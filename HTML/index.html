</head>
<body>The violin is a string instrument known for its expressive range, versatility, and beautiful sound. <br>

<p> <strong>Structure of the Violin</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Body: The main part of the violin, made of wood, usually maple, spruce, and ebony. It has a hollow structure, which helps produce a resonant sound.</li>
<li>Strings: The violin has four strings, tuned in perfect fifths: G, D, A, and E, from lowest to highest. These strings are made of gut, synthetic materials, or steel.</li>
<li>Bow: The violin is played with a bow, which is a stick of wood (usually pernambuco or carbon fiber) strung with horsehair. The bow is drawn across the strings to produce sound.</li>
<li>Fingerboard: The player presses the strings against the fingerboard to change the pitch of the notes.</li>
<li>Bridge and Sound Post: The bridge supports the strings, transferring vibrations to the violin's body, while the sound post inside the violin helps maintain its structure and sound quality.</li>
</ul>
